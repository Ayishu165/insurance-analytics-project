##End-to-End Insurance Risk Analytics & Predictive Modeling for ACIS
Project Structure & My Learning Journey
This project is broken down into four main tasks. Each task helps me build new skills and get closer to the final goal.

===Task 1:
      Project Planning & EDA: My first step is to explore the data to understand it. This is called Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). I will look for initial patterns and check the quality of the data.
====
Task 2: 
      Data Version Control (DVC): I will use a tool called DVC to track my dataset, just like how Git tracks my code. This is important to make sure my work is reproducible and organized.
====Task 3:
      A/B Hypothesis Testing: I will use statistics to test some ideas (hypotheses) about risk. For example, "Is there a real difference in risk between different provinces?". This helps make data-driven decisions.
====Task 4:
      Statistical & Machine Learning Modeling: The final step is to build models that can predict how much a claim might cost. This will be the core of a new, smarter pricing system.

==How to Run This Project (Setup Steps)
A) Clone the Repository
          Open your terminal or command prompt and run this command. This will download the project files to your computer.
B)Navigate to the Project Directory
C)Install Required Libraries
         This project uses a tool called Data Version Control (DVC). You can install it using pip.
D)Access the Data
        Because I'm using DVC to track the data, you'll need to run the following command to pull the dataset from my remote storage.
